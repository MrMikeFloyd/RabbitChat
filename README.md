# RabbitChat
Minimalistic client-server chat application based on RabbitMQ message routing.

##Purpose
This project has been part of a software engineering lecture at university. It is being used to illustrate the core functionality of a message oriented middleware, using RabbitMQ as a server-based message broker, and a few clients implementing the RabbitMQ client library. The software has intentionally been kept minimalistic and is not intended to be used in a productive environment.
